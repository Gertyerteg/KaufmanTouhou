## Story

Lich Queen NORTA, a half-undead machine, has been building a machine army for the past century. She hopes to take over the world and enslave its people. In 2150, Lich Queen NORTA unleashes her army against the Space Kingdom. Facing certain defeat, Princess Satele uses her magic powers to hold back the forces of NORTA, causing the war to come to a stalemate. Hoping to accelerate her advances, Lich Queen NORTA personally kidnaps Princess Satele. With the Space Kingdom at risk of invasion, the King sends Sir Norwood of Titan to rescue Satele. Before embarking on his adventure, the King warns Norwood of NORTAâ€™s three henchmen: the Corrupted Sun, the Asteroid-Bot, and Sir Fidget. He sends Corey and Chippy to assist Norwood on his adventure.
